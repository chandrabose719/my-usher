                        <p>Shout out to all the Harry Potter fans, there is a deal for all of you! But those who are not familiar with deathly hallows lets first explain why Harry Potter fans are this much excited for Deathly Hallows. Deathly Hallow is basically a symbol having line down at the middle of circle which is itself inscribed in the triangle. These three fundamental parts of deathly hallows represents certain analogies where circle refers to the Resurrection Stone, line refers to the Elder Wand and triangle represents the Invisibility Cloak. The symbol is so famous that you will interestingly find deathly hallow in following places:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Deathly hallow is inscribed on the tomb of Ignotus Peverell.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Albus Dumbledore was so inspired and attracted to this symbol that he replaced A in his signature with deathly hallows.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Xeno Lovegood embraces its sanctity to him by wearing necklace of deathly hallows.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Deathly hallows is inscribed in the tales of Beedle the Bard.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Deathly hallows is inscribed on the resurrection stone.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So that was the explanation for all those who were not the fan of Harry Potter series while for Harry Potter fans, following picture is self-explanatory:</p>
