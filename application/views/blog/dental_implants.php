                        <p>Dental implant surgery and teeth braces have saved people from a great deal of pain when dealing with complications in the teeth. The tooth implant basically works to support an artificial tooth that has been manually placed. It acts as a kind of a dental bridge to sustain the position until a replacement tooth can be placed. Teeth braces are used in a similar manner whereas people whose teeth are misaligned can use braces as a form of support to keep the position of the teeth in place.</p>
                        <p>The field of dental surgery, due to rapid advancement in technology, is changing. However, it is important to note the basic surgical complications that usually arise and how they can be tackled with modern equipment or technology. One such challenge is to accurately measure and identify the position of where the tooth implant will go respective of each specific person. Another problem faced is fabricating crowns and other dental equipment such as braces respective of the client, which were historically made by the dentists themselves; but as surgical techniques grew, accuracy in measurement and fabrication became a major issue. Another problem facing people taking a visit to the dentist is the high cost of modern braces and their related treatments that cost patients thousands of dollars a year. But, this is all changing due to 3D printing. </p>

                        <p>Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, allows users to design objects at extremely high accuracy and precision with a new level of detail. In this regard, orthodontists have been given access to an exciting new technology that can help improve the accuracy in dental implant surgery (such as with implanting dental crown and dental veneers) and deal directly with consumers with equipment such as teeth braces without being overly dependant on third-party suppliers. With 3D printing technology, the need for taking extremely precise measurements has changed, as 3D scanners are capable of taking an automatic scan of the entire jaw; and thus enabling orthodontists to accurately perform denture implant surgery, such as with a dental bridge. With regards to teeth braces, the high-cost of selective braces being made according to each patient has drastically changed has 3D printers allow the control of strength and general quality of the object, thus enabling dentists to themselves provide patients with low-cost braces with a high degree of accuracy due to the cutting edge scanner technology involved. </p>

                        <p>The four main techniques involved in 3D printing braces and during a dental implant are Digital Light Projection (DLP), Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), Liquid Crystal Diode (LCD) and Laser Stereolithographic Apparatus (LSA). Results from these techniques vary with each carrying its own pros and cons such as speed in printing, accuracy, and resolution being decisive factors. </p>
                        <p>In the end, one can conclude the increase in precision, convenience and reduced time in surgery and lower-costs (such as with teeth braces and dental implant cost), to be attractive features in shaping the dental industry through 3D printing in the near future. </p>
