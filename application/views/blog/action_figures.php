                        <p>It was a fresh morning,</p>
                        <p>As he woke up, he turned to see the time on his table clock, “IM LATE!!!!!” he screams as he rushes out of his room barely brushing his teeth. He slipped down the stairs but that was the least of his concerns for he was running towards his dream.</p>
                        <p>He rushed to the laboratory, “PROFESSOR OAK!! I’m sorry I got late! Is there anything left?”</p>
                        <p>The old man looked at him, “Ahh Ash! So, you finally decided to show up… I’m sorry all three of them have been taken” he shook his head.</p>
                        <p>“Come on professor there has to be something! I’ve waited for today since forever. Don’t be like that”</p>
                        <p>“Well, there is one… but I don’t really recommend it”</p>
                        <p>“Its fine ANYTHING WORKS FOR ME!”</p>
                        <p>And hence began the “electrifying” journey of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu. If this narrative left you all nostalgic, there’s a 100% chance that you had an amazing childhood, and there’s about a 90% chance that you’ve played the Pokémon games and you’ve probably come across these terms Super Smash Bros, Smash bros ultimate and Smash bros melee, and you’re most probably smiling now. Well, that’s because of the impact smash bros has made on our childhood.</p>
                        <p>The game brought together our favorite characters from all around the Nintendo world from fighters like Ryu to Red and his Charizard. Super Smash Bros Ultimate launched recently on Nintendo switch, beating out records previously held by games such as Pokémon: Let&#39;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#39;s Go, Eevee!, Super Mario Odyssey, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In Japan, Ultimate outsold the records held by Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS with 2.6 million copies sold in five weeks. It is also one of the best-selling games for the Nintendo Switch, with 12.08 million copies sold worldwide by the end of 2018.</p>

                        <p>But just the game isn’t always enough now, is it? We need the feel in hand, so what’s the best option? 3D Printed ACTION FIGURES and… 3D Printed MINIATURES!</p>
                        <p>These figures have been sold since forever and have done millions in sales but these carry so much more value. Their value stands in the joy, the excitement and the action that they bring for the children. This Super Smash Bros roster has brought together so many characters, and as a result of this, the fans always have something to look forward to. (The roster has grown from a mere 12 characters to 77 characters!)</p>
                        <p>People can stage their own imaginary fights, make collections and show off the newest and latest 3D printed action figure.</p>
                        <p>But one problem people often had is, that their collection stood at the mercy of the designers, but now we face the misery no more. 3D printing is now giving us the opportunity to create our own action figures and eternalize out favorite characters and moments on our shelves. Now you can get your favourite character designed and 3D Printed in just a few days, just describe what you want and dedicated people at 3D Usher will get it made for you. </p>
