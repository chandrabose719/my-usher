                        <p>Segmentation not so long ago was the holy grail of marketing is quickly falling down to the level of a mere anachronism. Customers no longer want to be anonymous, they want to be treated like individuals and are running towards brands who respect that.</p>
                        <p>Earlier however due to lack of proper technology, there was only so much that can be personalized. However, from the early 2010’s the democratization of additive manufacturing or 3D Printing has allowed people to print their way through this problem. 3D Printers have offered a cheaper and faster solution to making products in lower quantities, allowing people to print almost anything they wish for.</p>
                        <p>The trend has gone to the extent where people are now printing themselves personalized mobile covers, bracelets, and even KEYCHAINS!</p>

Printing themselves keychains right in all shapes and sizes, perfect to the way they like it. Some may have printed their favorite comic characters, while some went with a keychain with their own name or probably a photo keychain, to capture one of your memorable moments or even just a few kind words to keep their spirits up whenever they look at their keychain.</p>
                        <p>There must be a lot of people reading this article thinking “pfft, printing 3D Printing, that’s for nerds. It’s too complicated”. But these people couldn’t be further from the truth. Today a simple search on “How to print keychains” will show hundreds of results of companies with setup printers willing to help you make a keychain design or even do it completely for you.</p>
