                        <p>Custom keychains bring up a great way for you to reach that aesthetic feel that you normally wouldn’t be satisfied with readymade keychains. It is a kind of personalized gifts, as you get the advantage of coming up with your own design on an item that you can carry around all day. You can get your name printed, put a really cool logo there, or design characters etc. But, with this added advantage of customization comes the disadvantage of increased cost. As normally products such as keychains that are mass manufactured and made for a general market, such as for people looking to make an over-the-counter purchase, the prices are usually lower. When you enter a niche market such as custom gifts, or more specifically custom keychains, you usually have to pay a higher price because a company is making an entire product just for you. This is where 3D printing comes in.</p>
                        <p>Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, has revolutionized the market for customized products by giving people the advantage of reaching a new level of detail in manufacturing that was previously unheard of. Due to the revolutionary technology involved, customized products using 3D printing are way cheaper, along with the quality and strength of the product being in the hands of its user. Thus, the problem of added cost in custom keychains has been solved by replacing it with a 3D printed keychain.</p>
