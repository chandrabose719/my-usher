                        <p>Decoration pieces such as miniatures and figurines invoke a certain feeling to the viewer depending on the design and context. They’ve historically been used as religious and art pieces around the world and were historically hand-made. But, with the advent of technology, it became easier to mass manufacture them, and forward the process of adding more detail to the design. The primary market for miniatures and figurines today are as gifts, while other uses include them being used in the context of art and religion. </p>
                        <p>These miniatures and figurines can even be custom made. But, until recently, this came at a hefty price since handmade miniatures and figures take time and effort to make, and manufacturers would have to bare a high cost of production if they weren’t being mass produced. In this regard, 3D printing has without a doubt been a game-changer. Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, allows users to create a design on a computer and print a three-dimensional object just with a click of a button. It’s extremely cheap when compared with other methods, and allows more detail to be focused on when coming up with the design. This is due to users being handed the capability to choose the quality of the object being made.</p>

                        <p>Use cases of 3D printing include scanning a person and uploading the scanned image on a computer, and further printing a three-dimensional figurine. ‘3D selfies’ are a new category of 3D printing where the selfie can be rendered into a three-dimensional figurine. Other uses include personalized gifts, by coming up with your own design of the person being given the gift. Artists like Danny van Ryswk are using 3D printers to add a new level detail to their models. </p>
